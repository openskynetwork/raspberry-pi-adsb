Raspberry Pi ADS-B Base Station for OpenSky Network
===================================================

# Introduction

This guide explains how to assemble a simple ADS-B base station using Raspberry Pi and cheap off-the-shelf components
and how to connect your station to the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).

The proposed base station will be able to receive and decode transponder signals from planes in the radius of up to 200-300 km.

You will also be able to feed your data into [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) and other networks and use it in local applications like [PlanePlotter](http://www.coaa.co.uk/planeplotter.htm).

Instructions below are based on the [ADS-B using dump1090 for the Raspberry Pi](http://www.satsignal.eu/raspberry-pi/dump1090.html) guide.

This guide assumes installation in a home network with internet connection via router like FRITZ!Box.

# Prerequisites

* The most important prerequisite is place with clear view of the sky where you could place the antenna.
* If you want to feed your data into [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/), you must be able to open and forward ports on your router.
* [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) needs a static host name or IP address to connect to your base station.
If you don't have a static IP address (you normally don't), your router must support dynamic DNS using a provider like [DuckDNS.org](https://duckdns.org) [No-IP.com](http://www.noip.com/).
* Your router must support WiFi so that you could connect Raspberry Pi to the network wirelessly.

# Shopping list

We'll assume that you already have a PC with microSD or SD card reader, monitor with HDMI connection and USB keyboard and mouse needed for installation and that you don't have to order the additionally.
  
## Notes on the shopping list

* You will need a 2A power supply for Raspberry Pi.
* Make sure memory card package includes the SD adapter so that you could use this card in a normal PC (which usually has a SD card reader but not the microSD.
* MicroSDHC Class 10 (high speed class) is highly recommended.
* If you connect the receiver to one of the USB port on Raspberry Pi directly, it will cover other ports. You can avoid this using the USB extension cable.
* You'll need a coaxial cable to connect your antenna to your USB RTL-SDR receiver. The shopping list above assumes an antenna with the N Female connector. The recommended [NooElec NESDR Mini 2+](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00VZ1AWQA) receiver has an MCX Female socket, so you basically need to connect MCX Female to N Female. Such cables (*MCX Male - N Male*) are quite rare, a much better option is a *N Male - SMA Male* plus *SMA Female - MCX Male* combination.
* The *N Male - SMA Male* plus *SMA Female - MCX Male* combination also using the [FlightAware band-pass filter](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B010GBQXK8) which reduces the noise and increases the number of the processed ADS-B messages. This filter has the *SMA Female* input and *SMA Male* output so it can be inserted between to cables (from antenna and to to receiver). If you want to spare the filter, just connect two cables directly.
* The [band-pass filter](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B010GBQXK8) is optional, but it is highly recommended. It drastically increases the number of messages.
* The [NooElec NESDR Mini 2+](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00VZ1AWQA) includes a small *SMA Female - MCX Male* adapter, so you don't necessarily need the *SMA Female - MCX Male* cable. However, if you use the [FlightAware band-pass filter](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B010GBQXK8), it is highly recommended to get *SMA Female - MCX Male* cable as well to add flexible connection between the filter and the receiver. Otherwise the filter is connected rigidly into the small MCX socket and as a potential to break it.

# Set up the Raspberry Pi

## Prepare the SD card with Raspbian operating system for Raspberry Pi

Follow the [NOOBS Setup](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/videos/) instructions. In short:
* [Download](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html) and install the SDFormatter (a software to format your microSDHC card).
* Insert your microSDHC memory card into your PC (using the SD adapter).
* Format the microSDHC card using SDFormatter. Make sure you've selected the correct drive letter. Use the options `FORMAT TYPE` `FULL (Erase)` and `FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT` `OFF`.
* [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) and unzip NOOBS ("New Out Of the Box Software", an easy operating system installer for Raspberry Pi).
* Copy the uzipped NOOBS files to the freshly formatted microSDHC card.
* Safely eject the memory card.

## Install Raspbian

* Insert the card into Raspberry Pi.
* Connect the power.
* Perform the Raspbian installation.
* Configure the system after installation (you'd typically want to set region and locale and change the default password (`pi`/`raspberry`).
* Set up the WLAN/internet connection.
* Update and upgrade the system:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
* Install `git-core` and `git`:
```
sudo apt-get install git-core git
```

Now your Raspberry Pi is ready to be used.

## Set up RTL-SDR drivers and `dump1090`

### Check out the `raspberry-pi-adsb` project

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/openskynetwork/raspberry-pi-adsb.git
chmod +x ~/raspberry-pi-adsb/*.sh
```

### Set up RTL-SDR drivers

Check out, build and install drivers for the RTL-SDR receiver:

```
cd ~/raspberry-pi-adsb
./setup-rtl-sdr.sh
```

You will be prompted to reboot after the set up.

After the system rebooted, you can check the RTL-SDR connection by running:

```
rtl_test
```

You should be seeing something like:

```
Found 1 device(s):
  0:  Realtek, RTL2838UHIDIR, SN: 00000001

Using device 0: Generic RTL2832U OEM
Found Rafael Micro R820T tuner
Supported gain values (29): 0.0 0.9 1.4 2.7 3.7 7.7 8.7 12.5 14.4 15.7 16.6 19.7 20.7 22.9 25.4 28.0 29.7 32.8 33.8 36.4 37.2 38.6 40.2 42.1 43.4 43.9 44.5 48.0 49.6 
[R82XX] PLL not locked!
Sampling at 2048000 S/s.

Info: This tool will continuously read from the device, and report if
samples get lost. If you observe no further output, everything is fine.

Reading samples in async mode...
```

This means RTL-SDR drivers were compiled and installed successfully.

### Set up `dump1090`

[`dump1090`](https://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090) decodes signals coming from the RTL-SDR receiver.

Check out, build and install `dump1090`:

```
cd ~/raspberry-pi-adsb
./setup-dump1090.sh
```
The `setup-dump1090.sh` also installs `dump1090` as a service so that `dump1090` starts automatically after system restart.

You will be once again prompted to reboot after the set up. 

After the system rebooted, you might want to check if `dump1090` is running correctly. Just go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in the browser on Raspberry Pi, you should see a map with planes.

![Screenshot of dump1090 on localhost](images/dump1090-on-localhost.png)

Alternatively, you can start `dump1090` in the interactive mode from the command line. To do this, first stop the running `dump1090` service:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/dump1090.sh stop
```

Now start the `dump1090` in the interactive mode:

```
~/dump1090/dump1090 --interactive --gain -10 --net --net-beast
```

You should be getting output like:

```

...
```

Finally, start the `dump1090` service again:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/dump1090.sh start
```

### Install the feeder

Just follow the steps mentioned here: https://opensky-network.org/community/projects/30-dump1090-feeder

Once you set everything up and entered your OpenSky username correctly, it'll show up in your receiver profile (My OpenSky > Receiver Profile).
